For the synthetic dataset, we first explore the parameter space of the problem.
Based on the Creation of the synthetic dataset block in @SBD_test_multi.m, here are the key parameters needed to create a synthetic multi-kernel observation dataset:
1. num_kernels: Number of kernels (e.g. 2 in this case)
2. n: Number of energy layers per kernel (e.g. 1 in this case)
3. image_size: Size of the output image (e.g. [300, 300] in this case)
4. kernel_size: Size of each kernel (e.g. [50, 50] for both kernels in this case)
5. theta_cap: Maximum probability for kernel activation (e.g. 1e-4 in this case)
6. SNR: Signal-to-Noise Ratio (e.g. 10000 in this case)
Additionally, there are some derived or randomly generated parameters:
7. theta: Actual activation probabilities for each kernel (randomly generated)
8. b0: Bias term (randomly generated)
9. The kernels themselves (A0) are initialized using slices from a pre-loaded simulated LDoS (Local Density of States) data.

Purpose of testing the parameter space is to test the robustness of the algorithm with respect to the parameter changes.

some extreme cases are:
1. noise-free case
2. very dense activation map
3. very sparse activation map
4. overlapping kernels

Useful tests should be performed in single parameter space while fixing other parameters to be ideal cases.
Here we define what is an ideal case.
num_kernels does not matter, as long as it is a multi-kernel problem.
n does not matter as long as it is a single layer problem.
image_size does not matter as long as it is a large enough image.
kernel_size does not matter as long as it captures the whole structure of the kernels.

Test noise_level:  
Fixed parameters: num_kernels = 2, n = 1, image_size = [300, 300], kernel_size = [[50, 50],[50,50]], theta_cap = 2e-4, b0 = 0. 
Changing parameters: SNR, A0

Note: we want to test the performance of the algorithm with respect to the noise level and the inital guess of the kernels.
