some feedbacks from Jisun and Sarah on the benchmark datasets:
1. symmetry of the kernel may not be the same in real cases, the feature of QPI might be the same, but the feature of defects might not.
2. theta_cap/pixel and image_size may not be good parameters, as in the physical case, optimal density of pixel per nm is defined by the 
    target resolution in real space(and target range of the q-space), therefore, the real considerations are:
    a) size of unit cell in real space -> determines pixel per nm 
    b) helium/ nitrogen holding time -> determines total pixel number 
3. SNR should be defined with respect to the noise level of the detector, which need further investigation.

- Markus's feedback on the consistency of the algorithm: 
We should run the algorithm multiple times on the same dataset with the same initial conditions and see if the results are the same. Maybe say 5 times.

- Dong's feedback: 
Want residual metrics, defined as Residual quality: var(noise)/var(Y-sum-(Y_each_kernel)), already exists in computeResidualQuality.m
Want to create a demixing metric, verbally defined as how successful the algorithm is in separating the individual kernels.
    This can be done by: normalized([element-wise product(all reconstructed&gaussian-filtered activations)])- normalized(element-wise product(all original&gaussian-filtered activations))
